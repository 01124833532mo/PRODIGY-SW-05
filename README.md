# Task05 for PRODIGY-SW-05 Create a Web Scraping

## 1. Web Scraping with HttpClient and HtmlAgilityPack:
-The program uses HttpClient to fetch the HTML content of a webpage.
-HtmlAgilityPack is utilized to parse and navigate the HTML structure, making it easier to extract specific elements such as product names, prices, and ratings.

## 2. XPath-based Data Extraction:
-The program leverages XPath to precisely target and extract relevant data from the HTML document.
-Book Titles: Extracted from anchor (<a>) tags inside <h3>.
-Prices: Extracted from <p> elements with a specific class (price_color).
-Ratings: Extracted from the class attribute (e.g., "star-rating Three") of a paragraph (<p>) element.

## 3. Structured Data Storage (CSV Export):
-After extracting product details, the program stores the data in a CSV file using the CsvHelper library.
-CSV is a structured format that can be easily opened in Excel, Google Sheets, or any text editor, making it suitable for analysis and reporting.

## 4. Class-based Representation:
-The program uses a Product class to encapsulate the details of each product (name, price, rating).
-This class-based approach allows the program to organize and manage the extracted data efficiently.

 ## 5. Automation and Scalability:
-The program automates the extraction of product information from a webpage without manual intervention.
-The solution can be easily expanded to scrape multiple pages or more complex websites by modifying the URL and adding pagination handling.

## 6. Error Handling Potential:
-Although the current example doesn't include advanced error handling, it can be extended to handle scenarios like:
-Missing Elements: If a product's name or price is not found, the program can handle such cases gracefully.
-Network Failures: Retry mechanisms can be added in case of failed HTTP requests.

## 7. Customization:
-The program is easy to adapt to other e-commerce websites. By updating the URL and XPath selectors, you can scrape any website with a similar HTML structure.
-You can also modify the fields to extract other information such as product descriptions, stock availability, or discounts.

## 8. Efficiency and Performance:
-HtmlAgilityPack is lightweight and efficient for parsing large HTML documents.
-The program performs data extraction and writing to CSV without requiring extensive resources, making it suitable for small to medium-scale scraping tasks.

## 9. CSVHelper for Clean CSV Writing:
-The use of CsvHelper ensures that the data is written to the CSV file in a clean and structured way, with proper handling of special characters and formatting.

## 10. Extensible for Advanced Use Cases:
-This code can be extended with additional features such as:
-Handling Pagination: Scraping data from multiple pages of the website.
-Data Filtering: Adding conditions to scrape only certain types of products (e.g., filtering by price range or rating).
-Integration with Databases: Storing the scraped data into a database for further processing or analysis.
